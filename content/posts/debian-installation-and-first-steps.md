# Installation

Debian doesn't come with non-free firmwares, so it can be necessary to install them. In Debian's download page (page with the .iso files) has a link for the firmwares.

You can use the same USB with the bootable Debian for those firmwares: after restore the Debian's ISO into an USB, you can create a new partition with `$ fdisk /dev/sdb` and change it to `FAT16` with `mkdosfs /dev/sdbX`.
Those firmwares have to be unpackaged to `/firmware` path in the new USB partition.

Another much more easy way to do it, it's to download the ISO image built already with the non-free [firmwares](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/).

## Before installing

Don't forget to make sure the `.iso` you downloaded is not tampered by any third party. As Debian includes the signatures in the same folder you got the `iso`, you can easily check this using `gpg`:

```sh
# Check integrity of the file containing the SHASUM (you may need to import the keys from Debian's keyserver)
$ gpg --verify SHA512SUMS.sign SHA512SUMS

# Get the shasum of the file
$ shasum -a 512 file.iso

# Check if the shasum generated by Debian matches with the `iso` one
$ cat SHA512SUMS
```

# First steps

1. Comment `deb cd-rom:` repos in `/etc/apt/sources.list` file.

1. Install and configure sudo (not necessary if you leave the root password empty on installation).

   1. `$ su`
   1. `$ apt-get update`
   1. `$ apt-get install sudo`
   1. `$ usermod -a -G sudo your_user`
   1. Restart

1. Install the Microsoft fonts.

   - `echo 'deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian jessie main contrib' >> /etc/apt/sources.list` (not necessary in some mirrors: US for example)
   - `sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer`

1. Rearrange window buttons (close, minimize...) to left.

   - `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout "close,minimize,maximize:"`

1. Show only applications from the current workspace in Alt+Tab.

   - `gsettings set org.gnome.shell.app-switcher current-workspace-only true`

1. Disable alt+f1 shortcut key.

   - `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings panel-main-menu "[]"`

1. Install some awesome extensions from [Gnome Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/):

   - **Frippery move clock**: it moves the centered clock to the right of the gnome bar.
   - **Lock keys**: useful for keyboards the don't have status LED for Caps lock and Num lock keys.
   - **No topleft hot corner**: it prevents the default gnome's behaviour to show up the activity view when the mouse points in window's top left corner.
   - **Panel osd**: to customize notification's position in the screen.
   - **Random Walls**: it changes automatically and randomically the wallpaper and lock screen image.
   - **Topicons plus**: changes the tray icons to the top.
   - **Workspace indicator**: shows the active workspace.
   - **Docker integration**: hides _veth_ networks from gnome interface.
   - **ESC to close overview from applications list**: when in the overview screen, close it without show the application list.
   - **Dash to Dock**: A mac dock style for linux.
   - **Workspace Isolated Dash**: Isolate each workspace as if it was the only workspace.

1. Install a beaultiful theme for Gnome:
   - `$ sudo apt install numix-gtk-theme`
   - `$ sudo apt install numix-icon-theme`

## Updating git

There is a git-core team ppa for Debian, for install the latest version of git: [Git-core PPA](https://launchpad.net/~git-core).

You have to add the PGP key available on the site. The key can be exported to a file and added to Debian with the `sudo apt-key add` command.

## Printing in a HP

1. Install the printer drivers:
   - `sudo apt-get update`
   - `sudo apt-get install cups hplip`
1. Configure the printer through the hp plugin:
   - `sudo hp-setup -i`

# Troubleshooting

## Brazilian accentuation in American keyboards

You must use `English (US, international with dead keys)`.

### Ć instead of Ç

You need to put `GTK_IM_MODULE=cedilla` in `/etc/environment` file. After that, logout and login again.
